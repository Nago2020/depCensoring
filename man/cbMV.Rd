\title{Combine bounds based on majority vote.}
\usage{
cbMV(results.list, threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{results.list}{List object containing the individual identified
intervals.}

\item{threshold}{Threshold proportion of identified intervals a given value
should be contained in in order for it to be included in the combined
identified interval. For intersection bounds, set this value to \code{1}.}
}
\value{
The combined identified interval.
}
\description{
This function combines a list of individual identified intervals
to a single one based on majority vote. Note that the intersection of all
intervals can be viewed as a majority vote as well, so that it is included as
a special case.
