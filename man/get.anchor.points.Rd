\title{Get anchor points on which to base the instrumental functions}
\usage{
get.anchor.points(data, n.if.per.cov, normalized = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data set.}

\item{n.if.per.cov}{Number of instrumental functions to use per continuous
covariate.}

\item{normalized}{Boolean value indicating whether the covariates in the
given data frame have been normalized. Default is \code{normalized = FALSE}.}
}
\description{
The points returned by this function can be used as corner
points in the family of box functions, or as knots in the family of B-spline
functions.
