\arguments{
\item{x}{The vector of covariates at which to evaluate the B-splines}

\item{g.idx}{The index of the instrumental function.}

\item{data}{Data frame containing the data.}

\item{n.if.per.cov}{Number of instrumental functions per continuous covariate.}

\item{idxs.c}{Vector of indices of the continuous elements in the vector of
covariates.}

\item{G.c}{Family of instrumental functions to use for the subvector of
continuous covariates.}

\item{norm.func}{Function to be used to normalize the covariates.}

\item{info.manycov}{Data frame containing some information about the global
structure of the instrumental functions of this class. If
\code{info.manycov = NULL}, it will be computed during execution. Default is
\code{info.manycov = NULL}.}

\item{cov.ranges}{Matrix containing as its rows the lower and upper bounds
for each continuous covariate. Default is \code{cov.ranges = NULL}.}

\item{degree}{Degree of the spline functions to be used as instrumental
functions for the continuous covariates (if applicable). Default is
\code{degree = 3}.}
}
\description{
This function defines the family of discrete/continuous
instrumental functions in the case of many covariates. It does so by
considering a instrumental functions for each pair of entries in the given
covariate vector.
