\title{Partially identify the coefficients in the model
\eqn{\Lambda(x^\top \beta(t))} for the given data set. This methodology
implements the one described in Willems et al. (2024+).}
\usage{
pi.surv(
  data,
  idx.param.of.interest,
  idxs.c,
  t,
  par.space,
  search.method = "GS",
  add.options = list(),
  picturose = FALSE,
  parallel = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing the data on which to fit the model. The
columns should be named as follows: 'Y' = observed timed, 'Delta' = censoring
indicators, 'X0' = intercept column, 'X1' - 'Xp' = covariates.}

\item{idx.param.of.interest}{Index of element in the covariate vector for
which the identified interval should be estimated. It can also be specified
as \code{idx.param.of.interest = "all"}, in which case identified intervals
will be computed for all elements in the parameter vector.}

\item{idxs.c}{Vector of indices of the continuous covariates. Suppose the
given data contains 5 covariates, of which 'X2' and 'X5' are continuous, this
argument should be specified as \code{idxs.c = c(2, 5)}.}

\item{t}{Time point for which to estimate the identified set of
\eqn{\beta(t)}.}

\item{par.space}{Matrix containing bounds on the space of the parameters. The
first column corresponds to lower bounds, the second to upper bounds. The i'th
row corresponds to the bounds on the i'th element in the parameter vector.}

\item{search.method}{The search method to be used to find the identified
interval. Default is \code{search.method = "GS"}.}

\item{add.options}{List of additional options to be specified to the method.
These options can range from 'standard' hyperparameters such as the
confidence level of the test and number of instrumental functions to be used,
to technical hyperparameters regarding the search method and test
implementation. For the latter, we refer to the documentations of
\code{set.hyperparameters}, \code{set.EAM.hyperparameters} and
\code{set.GS.hyperparameters}. We recommend to use the default parameters,
unless you really know what you are doing.}

\item{picturose}{Picturosity flag. If \code{TRUE}, a plot illustrating the
workings of the algorithm will updated during runtime. Default is
\code{picturose = FALSE}.}

\item{parallel}{Flag for whether or not parallel computing should be used.
Default is \code{parallel = FALSE}. When \code{parallel = TRUE}, this
implementation will use \code{min(detectCores() - 1, 10)} cores to construct
the parallel back-end.}
}
\value{
Matrix containing the identified intervals of the specified
coefficients, as well as corresponding convergence information of the
estimation algorithm.
}
\description{
This function estimates bounds on the coefficients the single-
index model \eqn{\Lambda(x^\top \beta(t))} for the conditional CDF of the
event time.

\examples{
\donttest{
  #     - Link function: AFT link function (default setting)
  #     - Number of IF: 5 IF per continuous covariate (default setting)
  #     - Search method: Binary search
  #     - Type of IF: Cubic spline functions for continuous covariate, indicator
  #       function for discrete covariate (default setting).

  colnames(data) <- c("Y", "Delta", "X0", "X1", "X2")

  # Settings for main estimation function
  idx.param.of.interest <- 1 # Interest in effect of age
  idxs.c <- 1                # X1 (age) is continuous
  t <- 200                   # Model imposed at t = 200
  search.method <- "GS"      # Use binary search
  par.space <- matrix(rep(c(-10, 10), 3), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

  # Estimate the identified intervals
